# HTML & CSS Tutorial Project - @SuperSimpleDev (Youtube Replica)

This repository is an implementation based on the tutorial video "[HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro | @SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&list=PLEPye7A7EcQZrT3VSBb7jtxnxIfY3yyG6&index=3),". It's important to note that this project may contain significant differences in the HTML and CSS code compared to the content presented in the original video.

## Important Differences

Please be aware of the following key differences between this project and the content of the original video:

- The HTML and CSS in this project may differ from the tutorial due to the learning process. I followed a practice of pausing the video, attempting the exercises, and then comparing my solution to the video's solution. This iterative approach led to variations in the code.

- All exercises and challenges suggested in the video were completed as part of this project. The solutions provided here represent my own understanding and implementation.

## Purpose of This Tutorial Project

The primary purpose of creating this tutorial project was to review and reinforce my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3. By following along with the video and completing the exercises independently, I aimed to solidify my skills in front-end web development.
